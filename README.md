Where we hold things

This is a project where we have to answer question based on data and what to do with this data. We are Yesenia and Heriberto and were trying to find out certain things on crime. 

Questions (based on data cpollected): 
  - What state (and what city) has the most crime rate?
  - What causes crimes?
  - Which state doesn't have so much laws/regulations?
  - How are prisons treating inmates?
  - Out of how many crimes were shots fired?
  
  - does terrorism affect the number of plane crashes?
  - which country has the most deaths caused by terrorism?
  - WHICH COUNTRY HAS THE MOST DEATHS?
  - are we safer to be outside than what it was back then?
